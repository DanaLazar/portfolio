      <h2>Hello, I am Dana</h2>
      <p>
        My journey in tech began as a content creator and product manager, where
        I honed my skills in understanding user needs and translating them into
        effective digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2018, I&rsquo;ve been dedicated to frontend development, starting
        with the fundamentals: HTML, CSS, and responsive design. My early work
        involved creating dynamic and user-friendly websites, including
        extensive experience with WordPress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past two years at Zitec, I&rsquo;ve deepened my expertise in
        modern frontend technologies, focusing on React and Next.js. My work has
        involved building scalable, high-performance applications that
        prioritize user experience and accessibility.
